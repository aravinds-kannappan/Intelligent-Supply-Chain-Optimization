## Technical Deep Dive

### Machine Learning Models

#### Demand Forecasting Model
```python
# XGBoost with advanced feature engineering
- Time-based features (seasonality, trends)
- Lag features (1, 7, 30, 90 days)
- Rolling statistics (mean, std, volatility)
- Product lifecycle and market factors
- Cross-validation with time series splits
```

#### Supplier Optimization Model
```python
# Multi-objective optimization
- K-means clustering for supplier segmentation
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Network analysis for relationship mapping
- MCDM for supplier selection
```

### Advanced SQL Analytics
```sql
-- Example: Supplier Performance Analysis with CTEs
WITH supplier_metrics AS (
    SELECT supplier_id, 
           AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality,
           STDDEV(quality_score) as quality_volatility,
           -- Performance trend analysis
           AVG(CASE WHEN evaluation_date >= date('now', '-6 months') 
                    THEN quality_score END) as recent_quality
    FROM supplier_performance 
    GROUP BY supplier_id
)
-- Complex joins and window functions for insights
```
